# SyncAccruals_queries
Herein are all the queries needed to build the Royalty reports during the Sync accruals process. Previously, we had all the queries stored in Google Sheets. To make sure they're accessible to everyone, I've stored them here with a few comments.
You can always refer to this sheet:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dZA6LNE0am8sKv7Ny-nyZHXGat1i9UJ5EA6YwswEP-E/edit#gid=0 for further info/process.
